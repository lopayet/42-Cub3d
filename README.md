A somewhat simple raycasting project written in C with my friend: https://github.com/ValiSpac

Raycasting involves simulating 3D rendering in an actually 2D space by casting rays from the player.
These rays are casted and eventually hit a wall in the 2D space.
The distance between the start of the ray (player) and the wall then helps to simulate depth for the rendering.
If you want to do a raycasting project yourself, you can google it or search on youtube and find a gorillion tutorials.

Here are screenshots of for this project:
